<!-- Deploy DIST 
Every time you build the static bundle, generated files are in dist directory. Since dist folder is now gh-pages branch, you can deploy it directly by just creating a commit and pushing it.

cd dist
git add --all
git commit -m "Deploy on gh-pages updated"
git push origin gh-pages
This way nothing was added to the master branch history, keeping it clean.
